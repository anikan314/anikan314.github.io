Read [this](https://voices.uchicago.edu/mayalozinski/2021/06/03/md-phd-in-health-economics-admissions-coursework/) first.

I largely concur with what Maya’s written. I wasn’t a biology major (majored in economics, minored in data science), but there were a few programs that asked specifically for at least one upper-level course in biology/chemistry/physics, so I made it a point to take a couple during my undergraduate study. I also had an upper-level science course professor write me a letter of recommendation; many programs ask for at least one letter from a professor in the “sciences” (which does not include social sciences). You can check for further program-specific requirements online.

Some schools have strict requirements on pre-medical coursework whereas others are more flexible and are willing to accept Advanced Placement (AP) examination credit. Personally, I did not take any general chemistry in college and started in organic. This didn’t cause me any issues during the application process.

I do not think graduate-level coursework in economics/econometrics is required of MD/PhD applicants. I certainly did not take any of these courses. I took math classes up to (and including) Real Analysis in college, such as Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Econometrics.

I am also an advocate for taking a programming course (or courses, if you end up liking it as much as I did!) as an undergraduate. Any form of quantitative work within health economics/policy or health services research will require programming at some point of time.
