### Why an MD/PhD in health economics?

I love economics, research, and clinical practice----enough as to not want to sacrifice any of the three for the others. I wrote the following as part of an application essay and feel that it best represents my interest in pursuing a degree in health economics alongside medical training.

> Health economics offers the promise of unearthing the causal mechanisms underlying healthcare phenomena by applying rigorous theory and analytical methods to broader social questions about human behavior. For instance, the tools of economics can answer questions of how racial concordance (matching patients with providers of the same race) in doctor-patient relationships can improve prescription adherence and outcomes, how a physician’s propensity to prescribe opioids is influenced by the prescribing behavior of their peers, and how the lifestyle and environment of a pregnant mother is deterministic of the health of her children years down the line. As our nation’s healthcare landscape evolves, we must look to disciplines like economics to help us answer more significant questions about how health is uniquely shaped by every aspect of our lives in order to design sustainable and equitable solutions to the healthcare challenges we face.   

### So you want to pursue an MD/PhD?

I applied to MD/PhDs during the 2023-2024 application cycle. When I began the application process, I spent a lot of time scouring the internet for resources on the application process and potential careers as a social science MD/PhD. The lack of information and resources on social science MD/PhDs was frustrating, especially in comparison to the abundance of information on applying to a basic science MD/PhD. My hope is that this site can serve as a resource to anyone interested in pursuing an MD/PhD in the social sciences. 

I find [Maya Lozinski’s](https://voices.uchicago.edu/mayalozinski/home/blog/) posts on an MD/PhD in the social sciences to be quite thorough; I’ll do my best to add my thoughts to what she’s put out there.
