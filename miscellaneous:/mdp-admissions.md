### So you want to apply to an MD/PhD program? 

I applied to MD/PhDs during the 2023-2024 application cycle. When I began the application process, I spent a lot of time scouring the internet for resources on social science MD/PhDs. The lack of information and resources on social science MD/PhDs was frustrating, particularly in comparison to the abundance of information on applying to a basic science MD/PhD. My hope is that this site can serve as a resource to anyone interested in pursuing an MD/PhD in the social sciences. 

I find (Maya Lozinski’s posts)[https://voices.uchicago.edu/mayalozinski/home/blog/] on an MD/PhD in this field to be quite thorough on the subject of MD/PhDs in the social sciences. I’ll do my best to add my thoughts to what she’s put out there.
