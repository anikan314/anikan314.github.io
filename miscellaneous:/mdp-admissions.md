### So you want to pursue an MD/PhD?

I applied to MD/PhDs during the 2023-2024 application cycle. When I began the application process, I spent a lot of time scouring the internet for resources on the application process and potential careers as a social science MD/PhD. The lack of information and resources on social science MD/PhDs was frustrating, especially in comparison to the abundance of information on applying to a basic science MD/PhD. My hope is that this site can serve as a resource to anyone interested in pursuing an MD/PhD in the social sciences. 

I find [Maya Lozinski’s](https://voices.uchicago.edu/mayalozinski/home/blog/) posts on an MD/PhD in the social sciences to be quite thorough; I’ll do my best to add my thoughts to what she’s put out there.
