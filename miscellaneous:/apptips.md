Making a School List
</h2>

I get asked about this a lot—---how did you make a school list?

Many people use MSAR (subscription required) to guide their process of making a school list. For MD/PhD, however, I believe that the schools you apply to should be places where you can envision yourself having a successful research career. Hence, I prioritized research fit heavily when making my school list.

At baseline, not all programs offer trainees the opportunity to complete a PhD in the social sciences. I utilized AAMC's [List of MD/PhD Programs](https://students-residents.aamc.org/media/8131/download){:target="_blank"} as a “master list of all MD/PhD programs” of sorts. I then went to every program’s website to find the list of MD/PhD-affiliated graduate departments. If the school had a graduate affiliate in public health, health policy, health economics, or even epidemiology, I put it on my application list. This left me with about 35-40 schools.

Next, I went through the faculty at each of the graduate departments affiliated with each MD/PhD. I listed out faculty names whose work I was interested in and who might serve as mentors to me in graduate school. If I found fewer than three faculty members at a given institution, I removed it from my list. This narrowed me to about 30 schools.

Lastly, I removed schools with school-specific requirements that I would not be able to meet. For example, Johns Hopkins requires two science letters of recommendation, which I did not have. Columbia requires public health trainees to have an MPH, which I also did not have. Dartmouth and BU are not fully-funded, so I removed those programs. Though you should not be too picky about location, remove any places you know you would not be happy living in—---for me, this was Boston, so I removed Harvard from my list.

This left me with exactly 25 schools where I submitted primaries. You should expect to receive a secondary from every school; I feel that 25 secondaries was manageable enough to complete without going fully nuts by the end. Don’t underestimate the time it takes to complete secondaries—---each essay requires considerable thought, planning, care, and revision, and there’s only so much you can reuse from school to school.

Primary Essays

There’s a lot of information out there on how to write these statements, so I won’t spend much space on this subject. I strongly believe that for MD/PhD, your “Why MD/PhD?” is more important than your “Why MD?” essay. Your “Why MD/PhD?” should tell a story about how you realized that there is knowledge to be gained at the intersection of research and clinical medicine, and that you see this knowledge as enriching your future career. In contrast, the “Why MD?” should be dedicated to clinical interests, as you have plenty of space to discuss research in other essays.

My essay was about a paper that I read as it related to a clinical phenomenon I observed firsthand. I aimed to be honest about my experience and deeply reflective of how a social science PhD can benefit a practitioner and vice versa. Furthermore, I discussed the ways in which I saw my career as a social science MD/PhD progressing, specifically through uniting nontraditional stakeholders in healthcare. With my background working for the government and with nonprofit organizations on research initiatives, I had come to appreciate the incredible value research has for practitioners outside of the traditional academic sphere.

I had a number of research experiences I wanted to discuss in my Significant Research Essay. Accordingly, I numbered my research experiences (#1 - #5) and discussed each separately. I made sure to emphasize my role in each project and how it bolstered my interest in pursuing an MD/PhD.

Secondary Essays

By far the worst part of the cycle. You’re constantly writing and editing and feel like you’re in a never-ending tunnel. But once it’s finally over, the fun (interviews!) finally begins!

Again, there’s a lot out there on writing secondaries, so I won’t say too much. Stay organized; I had a large spreadsheet with dates so that I didn’t turn anything in too late. Most of my secondaries were turned in within three weeks, unless there was a two-week deadline specified. I tried to be creative, but honest, with my responses and write from the heart throughout. Grammarly was a lifesaver as I wrote, and I’d highly recommend paying for it (and canceling your membership as soon as you’re done). I had my parents and a couple friends edit most of what I wrote in real-time to help with clarity of message and conciseness. When I was lost for ideas, I didn’t hesitate to reach out to friends who helped me brainstorm and flesh out my ideas. Secondaries was where it really “took a village” to help me reach the finish line, and having a support system was key.

Writing the "Why X?" Essays
</h2>

I followed a pretty standard format with these: state my aims as a physician-scientist and how they parallel the MSTP’s mission/goal, mention research topics I was interested in and specific investigators I would want to work with, discuss ways in which my clinical training would complement my research training at that institution (i.e. I’m interested in studying how veterans make healthcare decisions, and attending clinic at the VA would help gain real-world insight into their decision-making), close with a statement of how training at X would make me a better physician-scientist.

I kept track of school-specific facts (programs, investigators, resources) in a separate document throughout the cycle. This list came in handy during interview preparation, where I wanted to make it abundantly clear that I had done my homework on X when I interviewed there.

Keeping Sane

Waiting is hard. No matter what anyone else tells you, it’s harder than you think it is. 

I’ll reiterate what many others told me and what I found out for myself during the application cycle: hobbies and having a strong support system keep you sane. It’s impossibly difficult to not check Reddit or SDN, so in your free time, it’s imperative that you engage with everything non-application-related as fully as possible. I’m incredibly thankful for my family, friends, peers, and mentors for cheering me on and believing in me throughout this process, and for serving as a listening ear when all I wanted to do was complain about how long the past year had been.
