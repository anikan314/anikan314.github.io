### So you want to pursue an MD/PhD?

When I was deciding whether to apply MD/PhD, MD-only, or forego applying to medical school entirely, I relied upon the experiences and advice of senior trainees and faculty to help guide me. I stumbled upon MD/PhD researchers in health economics whose careers I wanted to emulate through reading academic papers in my undergraduate courses in economics. I had been interested in both economics and medicine throughout college and pursued the two in parallel as an undergraduate. 

Here are what I conceptualized to be the differences between different training paths/careers. Again, this may differ based on who you talk to, and this is just my opinion.
