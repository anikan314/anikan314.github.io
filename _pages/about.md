# Hello!

I am an incoming MD/PhD candidate in health economics at the University of Pennsylvania's [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"} & [Department of Healthcare Management at Wharton](https://hcmg.wharton.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

I studied economics at [Northwestern](https://economics.northwestern.edu/){:target="_blank"} and worked as a research assistant at the [Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis](https://oema.army.mil){:target="_blank"} at the [U.S. Military Academy at West Point](https://www.westpoint.edu/){:target="_blank"} and U.S. Army. My research interests lie primarily within physician decision-making, the healthcare workforce, and healthcare organization. 

I'm always happy to chat about anything healthcare-related :)

I'm using this page to record my thoughts on MD/PhD training in real-time------feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the admissions or training process, and I'd love to connect!
