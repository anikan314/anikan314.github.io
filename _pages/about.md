# Hello!

I am an incoming MD/PhD candidate in health economics. 

I studied economics at [Northwestern](https://economics.northwestern.edu/){:target="_blank"} before taking two years to work as a research assistant at the [Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis](https://oema.army.mil){:target="_blank"} at the [U.S. Military Academy at West Point](https://www.westpoint.edu/){:target="_blank"} and U.S. Army. My research interests lie primarily within physician decision-making, the healthcare workforce, and healthcare organization. I'm always happy to chat about anything healthcare-related :)

I'm using this page to record my thoughts on MD/PhD training in real-time---feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the admissions or training process, and I'd love to connect!
